# bimanual-motor-online-task

Getting started

In order to run the script, you need to download PsychoPy builder (https://www.psychopy.org/). Further, you need an account with Pavlovia.org (https://pavlovia.org/) and link it to your PsychoPy builder (https://www.psychopy.org/online/usingPavlovia.html). Once this is established, you can open the script for the experimental task ‘bim_14102020.psychexp’ and synchronise it by pressing ‘sync’ (https://www.psychopy.org/online/fromBuilder.html). This will automatically create a project on Pavlovia and their associated Gitlab page. On Pavlovia, set your project to ‘running’ and you can start testing (https://pavlovia.org/docs/experiments/piloting-running).
